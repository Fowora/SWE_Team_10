[Main idea]
*To create a space where people can create and take quizzes on any topic and test each other’s understanding on said topic. One of the big goals of this app is to help people learn about topics created by the community.

[Key Features]
*Creating and Taking Community Quizzes-Each user has the ability to make their own quiz about a topic they are interested in where they would add their own questions and answers for the community to take.
*User profiles-The users will have to create a profile to login and take quizzes. They will also have the ability to view other users’ profiles and see the quizzes they created and took.
*Deleting Quizzes-Users will have the ability to delete the quizzes they created.


[Additional Features]
*Quiz Rankings-Quizzes will have a ranking section for the top users’ scores and quiz times. As well as, there will be a user ranking on their profile for their average score from all the quizzes they’ve taken.
*Public and Private Quizzes-Users have the ability to set their quizzes to private or public. Private quizzes would need a password to take that would be sent through invites to other users.
*Comments Section For Quizzes-Under each quiz there will be a comment section for discussion about the quiz questions/topic.
*Different Quiz Types-Each quiz will have a mode type where they would either be normal, untimed quizzes or a time-based quiz.
*Quiz Featured Section-A section in the web app that displays the most popular quizzes.
